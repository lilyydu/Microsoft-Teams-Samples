# Echo Bot Sample

This sample demonstrates a simple Echo Bot for Microsoft Teams using the Teams SDK. The bot echoes back any message sent to it. The same functionality is implemented in three different languages/platforms.

## Sample Implementations

| Language | Framework | Directory |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| C# | .NET 10 / ASP.NET Core | [dotnet/EchoBot](dotnet/EchoBot/README.md) |
| TypeScript | Node.js | [nodejs/echo-bot](nodejs/echo-bot/README.md) |
| Python | Python 3.12+ | [python/echo_bot](python/echo_bot/README.md) |

# How to run these samples

You can run these samples locally using the `agentsplayground` tool, without provisioning the Teams App, or you can run in the Teams Client after you have provisioned the Teams Application and configured the application with your local DevTunnels URL.

## Run in the `agentsplayground`

Install the tool agentsplayground for your platform

Windows

```
winget install agentsplayground
```

Linux

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-365-agents-toolkit/dev/.github/scripts/install-agentsplayground-linux.sh | bash
```

Other platforms (like MacOS, via npm)

```
npm install -g @microsoft/m365agentsplayground
```

Once the tool is installed, you can run the tool from your terminal with the command `agentsplaygroud`, and it will try to connect to `localhost:3978` where your bot is running.

## Run in the Teams Client

To run these samples in the Teams Client, you need to provision your app in a M365 Tenant, and configure the app to your DevTunnels URL.

1. Install the tool DevTunnels https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started
2. Get Access to a M365 Developer Tenant https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started
3. Create a Teams App with the Bot Feature in the Teams Developer Portal (in your tenant) https://dev.teams.microsoft.com

### Configure DevTunnels

Create a persistent tunnel for the port 3978 with anonymoys access

```
devtunnel create -a my-tunnel  
devtunnel port create -p 3978  my-tunnel 
devtunnel host  my-tunnel
```

Take note of the URL shown after *Connect via browser:*

### Provisioning the Teams Application

Navigate to the Teams Developer Portal http://dev.teams.microsoft.com

#### Create a new Bot resource

1. Navigate to `Tools->Bot management`, and add a `New bot`
1. In Configure, paste the Endpoint address from devtunnels and append `/api/messages`
1. In Client secrets, create a new secret and save it for later

> Note. If you have access to an Azure Subscription in the same Tenant, you can also create the Azure Bot resource ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=singletenant)).

#### Create a new Teams App

1. Navigate to `Apps` and create a `New App`
1. Fill the required values in Basic information (short and long name, short and long description and App URLs)
1. In `App features->Bot` select the bot you created previously
1. Select `Preview in Teams`

> Note. When using an Azure Bot resource, provide the ClientID instead of selecting an existing bot.

## Configure the new project to use the new Teams Bot Application

For NodeJS and Python you will need a `.env` file with the next fields

```
TENANT_ID=
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
```

For dotnet you need to add these values to `appsettings.json` or `launchSettings.json` using the next syntax.

appSettings.json


```json
"urls" : "http://localhost:3978",
"Teams": {
    "ClientID": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "TenantId": ""
  },
```

Or to use Env Vars from the profile defined in `launchSettings.json` (using the Environment Configuration Provider)

```json
 "teamsbot": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:3978",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "Teams__TenantId": "YOUR_TenantId",
        "Teams__ClientID": "YOUR_ClientId",
        "Teams__ClientSecret": "YOUR_ClientSecret"
      }
    }
```

## Pro Tip: Read the configuration settings using the Azure CLI

To obtain the TenantId, ClientId and SecretId you can use the Azure CLI with:

> Note. If you dont have access to an Azure Subscription you can still use the Azure CLI, make sure you login with `az login --allow-no-subscription` 

```
az ad app credential reset --id $appId
```
